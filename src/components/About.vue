            <p class="text-sm lg:text-base leading-normal lg:leading-relaxed">
                As a software engineer, we used to make a report about our daily activity at office. Sometimes, creating daily activity report is exhausting, since we only focused on our programming activity and forgot to write about our activity. <br class="mb-2 lg:mb-5">
                Since creating daily activity report could be a promble, I create an application to help us creating daily activity report. I hope, workify could help us compiling our workload into daily activity report.
